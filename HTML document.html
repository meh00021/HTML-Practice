Title = New beginning / HTML assignment 



Starting out with 1st impressions,

<html></html>

        The information I personally liked the most was the <q style ="background-color:, 
        as the names were unique and realistically interesting. What struck out to me was
        the story behind HOW the names were listed, about a guy showing up at a paint store,
        straight up asking for chip paints. The style of this online platform sort of reminds 
        me of coding, but more on the writing aesthetics. The original font is almost the same 
        as a typewriter, which is my personal favorite although it's not commonly used in writing
        fields. There were a few symbols I was brought to attention by, they are the use of less than 
        or equal to signs and a colon/semicolon. It makes me think of creating a set of equations and 
        the repetition of these symbols carries out the writing styles.

   <link/> "<link rel="stylesheet" href="">file:///C:/Users/tawme/OneDrive/Documents/demo.htmll/demo.html
            The free accesibility use of editing on another sit of platform, for example, <google chrome>,
            sets another perspective for the writer themselve to make changes and form even better ideas, 
            to make their writing a masterpiece. 

        <h1>Demo document</h1> 

            I would be interested in learning more about the remaining ways we can edit on <HTML:>
            A few curiosities I've come across after practicing the tools are having to do with the chronological order,
            almost like working with a regular paper on google docs, but with more complicated techniques available to control. 
            The way the spacing goes was what stood out to me, making it best to stay organized and be mindful when using HMTL.
            The color-mix(in hsl shorter hue, color percentage, color percentage)color-mix(in hsl shorter hue, color percentage, color percentage) is also 
            very fun to set changes to, as it'd help writers and beginners to not always follow a strict set of rules when using <HTML:xml></HTML:xml>. 
            Another way I think the use of background color and letter color choices are helpful is because it almost acts like a highlighting tool, that 
            helps the writer keep track of certain phrases, quotes, easy to forget words, and creates for a faster memorization, aside from the writing itself.

<html></html>"html"
        <head> 

            To end it off for the practices, I wanted to take note of how creating mini tage are really useful, as it saves the writer time and energy. The interactions 
            with <"HTML"/>. Almost anything can be found in a split second just by typing in these shortened words and symbols. I also think that working with HTML sets 
            for a useful practice step to becoming a professional teachnical writer. And I what I mean by this is <Html></Html> has search accesbilities to indexing content, that 
            helps to strengthen writing perspectives. I personally think that "<HTML></HTML> is one of the easiest editing tool platform for technical + professional writers. 
            Another way I thought of <html></html> as is almost like a design style of writing + editing. I think that this kind of editing is my favorite, even after learning
            about the rest of the other ways to edit in this course. It's almost the end, but I have a bit of things left I wanted to mention in this <html></html> document. And 
            that is another reason I find HTML to be the most useful for me, is how responsive and communicative it is towards the writer, and it helps improve collaboration 
            between content developers, designers, technical writer, and etc. One last that I really liked was the vertical lines on the left, I think it makes the entire piece of writing 
            look complete and doesn't stem away from the originality ways of writing, like the popular school websites.
